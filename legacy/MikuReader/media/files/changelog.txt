Beta 1.0.0.7
- Use MangaDex API to get images (why didn't I know this part of the API existed?)
- Legacy Reader is no longer required \o/
- Downloading improvements

If you are having issues, try deleting the save folder, the default location is %appdata%\MikuReader

As always, if you find a bug, let me know.
