## The Rewrite

MikuReader is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to enhance functionality and bring cross-platform mobile support.  This project is still in the early development phase.  Please submit any bugs or suggestions you have to the Issue tracker!

#### MikuReader-Core

_Core_ is a backend framework library.  All MikuReader implementations rely on _Core_ to provide all the objects and basic functionality MikuReader requires to function.

#### MikuReader-WF

The WinForms implementation.

#### MikuReader-Mobile

The Mobile implementations use Xamarin to deploy for both iOS and Android with a single UI.

## Legacy

The `Legacy` folder is home to the original version of MikuReader.  This version, while currently more full-featured than the rewrite, is very unstable and should probably be avoided.
